# Cryptomachine - a ThinkWise Product
This project has been worked on for around a week, starting from January 10th 2025 and is capable of performing several cryptographic tasks for several classical **cypher algorithms**, such as:
- Caesar 
- Vatsayana
- Vigenere
- Beaufort
- Autokey
- Playfair
- Two-Square
- Four-Square
